- Hello, I’m Zhouyou!
- I am an undergraduate student majoring in [Software Engineering](https://sw.scu.edu.cn/) at [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/). Currently, I am conducting research on prognosis prediction in the intelligent medical laboratory under the guidance of Professor Wang Yan. I am also looking for opportunities to intern in China.
- In the field of data science, I am also passionate about combining technology with art. My team and I once worked on a project on tea data visualization - "[灵芽之旅(TeaJourney)](https://lzy2275.github.io/teajourney/dist/)". This is a webpage showcasing the ecological journey of Chinese tea.
- My research interests are computer vision (CV) and data science (DS).
- I am currently applying for an internship opportunity. I enjoy full stack development and am more focused on front-end development.
- To learn more about me, you can download my resume here: [English version](/files/CV_en.pdf) or [Chinese version](/files/CV_ch.pdf).
